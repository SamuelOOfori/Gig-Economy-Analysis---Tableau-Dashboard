## Introduction
The Gig economy, built around short-term, flexible, and freelance jobs instead of traditional, long-term employment is a key feature of the digital labor market. As a work model, the gig economy offers workers flexibility and autonomy, while giving businesses cost-effective access to talent and services when they need them. This analysis is aimed at providing insights into this market across 5 different geographical areas, aiming to provide information to both freelancers and businesses that patronise their services across these platforms: Fiverr; General Freelancers; PeoplePerHour; Totptal; and Upwork. Data for the visualisation was sourced from two sources:

## Problem Statement

The Gig economy has grown rapidly since the dawn of the internet, broadening access to talent for businesses and work oppotunities for professionals. Freelancers and businesses nonetheless often struggle to predict job success rates across platforms, demand for certain skills, factors for success and often the most reliable platforms for freelancing. This has called for data-driven insights to forecast freelancer job trends and earnings, to which this analysis sought to answer. 

## Rationale for Project

This analysis in its attempt to answer the call for data-driven insights within this field aimed to: 
<ol>
  <li>Analyse freelancer job trends;</li>
  <li>Assess freelancer earnings;</li>
  <li>Identify key success factors;</li>
  <li>Provide a geographic overview of the Gig economy.</li>   
</ol>

## Project Plan 
The project was executed in six(6) steps spanning three tools: Microsoft Excel, Figma and Tableau. 
<ol>
  <li> First step involved a assessment of the Gig economy and the nature of this economy across contexts. This step largely involved reading articles and publications related to the subject matter to identify key parameters relevant in this field </li>
  <li>Next step involved data exploration to identify strengths and shortcomings of the data, followed by data cleaning and transformation in Microsoft Excel </li>
  <li>Next, the data importated into Tableau with necessary assigment of data types to ensure uniformity and coherence in analysis. A join was then initiated at the physcial level using the Freelance ID as the primary key </li>
  <li> Relevant charts were next enivsaged (planned) with relevant KPIs selected and then created in Tableau </li>
  <li> A wireframe for the visualisation was then created in Figma using the visualisation plan created in the previous step. The dashboard was sectioned into an executive and geographic view</li>
  <li> The dashboard was finally built in Tableau with key insights gleaned and drafted into a PowerPoint presentation </li>
</ol>

## Wireframe in Figma 
Taking advantage of the flexibility offered by designing in Figma, I desined my dashboard first in Figma then imported into Tableau.

</details>

## Dashboard 
The dashboard has two views, the Executive View and the Geographic View.
<ol>
  <li> The Executive View captures key insights about the data including the number of freelancers, the median job rates, the distribution of earnings across job types and experience, the job success ratings and the number of jobs completed.
